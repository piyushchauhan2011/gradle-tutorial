# Lesson 1: Introduction to Gradle

## Description
Overview of Gradle as a build tool, its benefits over others, and ecosystem.

## Key Concepts
- Build automation
- Declarative vs. imperative builds
- Gradle vs. Maven/Ant

## Runnable Examples
- Groovy DSL: Run `./gradlew hello` (prints "Hello, Gradle!")
- Kotlin DSL: Same command, uses the .kts file

## Exercises
1. Modify the task to print a custom message (e.g., "Hello, World!").
   - Edit the build.gradle or build.gradle.kts file.
   - Run `./gradlew hello` to verify.
