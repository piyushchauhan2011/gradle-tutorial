# Lesson 11: Consuming Published Artifacts

## Description
Using artifacts published to repositories in other projects.

## Key Concepts
- Repository configuration
- Dependency resolution
- Local repositories

## Runnable Examples
- Run `./g -p lesson11-consuming-artifacts run` (executes Main.java, which uses the Library from lesson10).

## Prerequisites

- Alternative: `./gradlew -p lesson10-publishing publish`
