# Lesson 11: Consuming Published Artifacts

## Description
Using artifacts published to repositories in other projects.

## Key Concepts
- Repository configuration
- Dependency resolution
- Local repositories

## Runnable Examples
- Run `./gradlew run` (executes Main.java, which uses the Library from lesson10).

## Prerequisites
- Run `./gradlew :lesson10-publishing:publish` first to publish the library.
